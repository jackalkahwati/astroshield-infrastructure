# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Actions Taken

We've successfully reduced the repository size from **2.1GB** to **1.1GB** (a 48% reduction) by implementing the following changes:

1. **Removed large binary files**:
   - Kafka binaries (kafka_2.13-3.9.0/ and kafka_2.13-3.9.0.tgz)
   - Model files (*.onnx, *.pth, *.pt)

2. **Removed regenerable directories**:
   - Node modules (frontend/node_modules/, supabase-test/node_modules/)
   - Virtual environments (env/, venv/)
   - Build artifacts (frontend/.next/)
   - Python cache files (__pycache__/, *.pyc, *.pyo, *.pyd)

3. **Added proper .gitignore**:
   - Prevents large files and regenerable directories from being committed
   - Includes patterns for common build artifacts, cache files, and environment directories

4. **Created backup directory**:
   - Preserved important large files in a backup directory
   - Added documentation on how to restore files when needed

5. **Added restructuring tools**:
   - Quick fix script for immediate size reduction
   - Comprehensive restructuring plan for long-term repository management
   - Documentation on best practices for repository management

## Size Comparison

| Directory | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Total     | 2.1GB  | 1.1GB | -48%      |
| frontend  | 582MB  | 956KB | -99%      |
| .git      | 485MB  | 485MB | 0%        |
| env       | 213MB  | 0MB   | -100%     |
| backend   | 167MB  | 120MB | -28%      |
| kafka     | 142MB  | 0MB   | -100%     |
| models    | 81MB   | ~1MB  | -99%      |
| venv      | 63MB   | 0MB   | -100%     |

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes** to the repository
2. **Inform team members** about the cleanup and how to restore files if needed
3. **Consider implementing Git LFS** for long-term management of large files
4. **Consider splitting the repository** into smaller, focused repositories

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Keep binary files out of Git**:
   - Use Git LFS for large files that need version control
   - Use external storage (S3, GCS) for large files that don't need version control

2. **Use proper dependency management**:
   - Document all dependencies in requirements.txt or package.json
   - Use virtual environments for Python projects
   - Use package-lock.json or yarn.lock for JavaScript projects

3. **Implement CI/CD pipelines**:
   - Automate building and testing
   - Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed during CI/CD

4. **Regular maintenance**:
   - Periodically clean up the repository
   - Remove unused files and dependencies
   - Update .gitignore as needed
