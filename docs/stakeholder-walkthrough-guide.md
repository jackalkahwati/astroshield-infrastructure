# Stakeholder Walkthrough Guide

## Purpose

This document provides a structured approach for guiding stakeholders and customer representatives through the AstroShield system to validate functionality, usability, and value delivery before launch. Running through these scenarios ensures that the system meets real-world user needs and captures feedback from key stakeholders.

## Preparation

Before conducting the walkthrough:

1. Schedule 60-90 minutes with the stakeholder or customer representative
2. Ensure the staging/pre-production environment is properly configured with:
   - Test accounts with appropriate permissions
   - Sample data that represents realistic scenarios
   - All integrations functioning properly
3. Prepare screen-sharing and recording tools if remote
4. Have a note-taker available to capture feedback
5. Prepare a feedback form for structured evaluation

## User Flow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Navigation and System Overview

**Objective**: Introduce the stakeholder to the system interface and basic navigation.

1. Log in using the customer test account credentials
2. Walk through the dashboard components:
   - Current conjunction summary
   - Alerts and notifications
   - System health indicators
   - Quick action buttons
3. Navigate through the main menu to demonstrate available features
4. Review user profile and account settings
5. Demonstrate help resources and documentation access

### Scenario 2: Historical Analysis Review

**Objective**: Demonstrate how to access and interpret historical analysis data.

1. Navigate to the Historical Analysis section
2. Use 25544 (ISS) as an example NORAD ID
3. Set a date range of the past 30 days
4. Execute the search and review the results
5. Explain key metrics as outlined in the historical analysis guide:
   - Position and velocity uncertainty
   - Threat levels and confidence values
   - Detected anomalies
6. Demonstrate filtering and sorting capabilities
7. Show how to export data for further analysis
8. Guide interpretation of a significant event within the data

### Scenario 3: Conjunction Assessment Workflow

**Objective**: Walk through the complete process of managing a new conjunction event.

1. Navigate to the Active Conjunctions dashboard
2. Select a high-risk conjunction example from the list
3. Review detailed conjunction information:
   - Primary and secondary object details
   - Miss distance and probability of collision
   - Time to closest approach
   - Object characteristics and tracking information
4. Demonstrate the conjunction assessment tools:
   - Viewing the 3D visualization of the conjunction
   - Running additional analysis with different parameters
   - Reviewing historical behavior of both objects
5. Show the maneuver planning capabilities:
   - Initiating a maneuver plan request
   - Setting constraints and objectives
   - Reviewing proposed maneuver options
   - Selecting and executing a maneuver plan

### Scenario 4: Alerting and Notification Configuration

**Objective**: Demonstrate how stakeholders can configure personalized alerts and notifications.

1. Navigate to the Alerts & Notifications section
2. Review the default alert settings
3. Demonstrate creating a new alert rule:
   - Selecting objects of interest
   - Setting threshold conditions
   - Configuring notification methods (email, SMS, integrated messages)
   - Setting priority levels
4. Test the alert with a sample scenario
5. Show the notification history and management tools
6. Demonstrate alert acknowledgment and escalation workflows

### Scenario 5: Custom Reporting

**Objective**: Show how to generate and customize reports for operational and management needs.

1. Navigate to the Reports section
2. Review available report templates:
   - Conjunction summary reports
   - Object behavior reports
   - System performance reports
3. Demonstrate creating a custom report:
   - Selecting metrics and parameters
   - Configuring visualization options
   - Setting up scheduled delivery
4. Generate a sample report
5. Export the report in different formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
6. Show how to share reports with team members

## Feedback Collection

After completing the scenarios, gather specific feedback on:

1. **Usability**: How intuitive was the system to navigate and use?
2. **Functionality**: Did the system demonstrate all required capabilities?
3. **Performance**: Was system response time acceptable?
4. **Value**: How effectively would the system solve the stakeholder's problems?
5. **Missing Features**: What additional capabilities would the stakeholder like to see?
6. **Concerns**: Are there any concerns about adoption or integration?

Use the following template for structured feedback:

## Follow-up Actions

1. Document all feedback received during the walkthrough
2. Categorize feedback into:
   - Critical issues that must be addressed before launch
   - Important enhancements for early post-launch updates
   - Feature requests for the product roadmap
3. Create actionable tickets for development team
4. Schedule a follow-up meeting to review changes if critical issues were identified
5. Communicate timeline for addressing non-critical feedback

## Checklist for Launch Readiness

After completing the walkthrough, assess launch readiness with this checklist:

- [ ] Stakeholder successfully completed all scenarios without significant assistance
- [ ] No critical usability issues were identified
- [ ] All core features functioned as expected
- [ ] System performance met stakeholder expectations
- [ ] Value proposition was clearly demonstrated and acknowledged
- [ ] Any identified critical issues have been addressed
- [ ] Stakeholder confirms readiness for use in their environment

## Walkthrough Script Template

Below is a template script that can be used to guide the walkthrough session:

```
Introduction (5 minutes):
"Thank you for participating in this walkthrough of the AstroShield system. Today, we'll explore the key features and workflows to ensure they meet your needs. Feel free to ask questions or provide feedback at any point. We're specifically looking to validate that the system works as expected and delivers the value you need.

Let's start by logging in and exploring the interface..."

[Proceed through each scenario, using a conversational approach that emphasizes how each feature addresses the stakeholder's specific needs]

Closing (10 minutes):
"That concludes our walkthrough of the key features. Based on what you've seen today:
- What aspects of the system do you find most valuable?
- Are there any workflows that seem confusing or inefficient?
- Are there any critical features missing that would prevent you from effectively using the system?
- Do you have any other feedback or questions?"

[Collect final feedback and explain next steps]
```

Remember that the goal is to validate readiness from the user's perspective, not to sell or market the product. Encourage honest feedback and take detailed notes on any issues or concerns raised.
