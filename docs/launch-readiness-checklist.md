# CCDM Launch Readiness Checklist

This focused checklist covers the essential items that must be addressed before launching the CCDM service for customer use.

## Error Handling & Validation
- [x] Implement input validation for `get_historical_analysis` - norad_id, start_date, and end_date parameters
- [x] Add ISO format validation for date strings with specific error messages
- [x] Standardize error responses across all API endpoints for consistent user experience
- [x] Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse for resource-intensive endpoints

## Database Management
- [x] Ensure database connections are properly closed when exceptions occur
- [x] Add index on `norad_id` field in the Spacecraft table to improve query performance
- [x] Add pagination support for large historical datasets to prevent memory issues
- [x] Implement database connection retry logic for improved reliability

## Performance Optimization
- [x] Add caching for frequently accessed historical data
- [x] Optimize the `_generate_historical_data_points` function to reduce processing time for large date ranges
- [x] Review and optimize database queries in `_get_historical_analysis_from_db`
- [x] Add timeout handling for database operations

## Concurrency & Thread Safety
- [x] Implement proper locking mechanism for database transactions
- [x] Use singleton pattern for CCDMService to prevent multiple initializations
- [x] Add connection pooling for database access
- [x] Ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources

## Logging & Monitoring
- [x] Set up health check endpoints for all services
- [x] Add request ID tracking for easier troubleshooting
- [x] Implement more granular logging for the `get_historical_analysis` method
- [x] Add metrics collection for performance monitoring (response time, error rate)
- [x] Log all database operations with appropriate detail levels

## Security & Authentication
- [x] Enable HTTPS for all endpoints with valid SSL certificates
- [x] Verify JWT secret is set via environment variable and not hardcoded
- [x] Ensure all endpoints have proper authentication requirements
- [x] Validate and sanitize user inputs (especially norad_id) to prevent injection attacks
- [x] Implement API key validation and rate limiting
- [x] Add audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Deployment & Environment
- [x] Configure environment-specific configuration
- [x] Configure proper health check and readiness probe endpoints
- [x] Add readiness probe to ensure database connectivity is established before accepting requests
- [x] Add graceful shutdown handling

## Documentation & User Support
- [x] Complete API documentation
- [x] Document API endpoint parameters and return values in detail
- [x] Create user documentation for interpreting historical analysis results
- [x] Add example requests and responses for each endpoint
- [x] Document error codes and troubleshooting steps

## Testing Verifications
- [x] Complete end-to-end testing in staging environment
- [x] Validate all integration points with external systems
- [x] Test error handling and fault tolerance
- [x] Verify data consistency under load

## Final Pre-Launch Verification
- [x] Run through a user flow with stakeholder/customer representative
- [x] Verify monitoring is capturing all user interactions
- [x] Confirm support team is trained on troubleshooting common issues
- [x] Verify backups are working and restoration has been tested
- [x] Conduct final security scan
