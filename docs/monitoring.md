## Alert Rules

### Critical Alerts

1. High Error Rate
   ```yaml
   alert: HighErrorRate
   expr: sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) > 0.05
   for: 5m
   labels:
     severity: critical
   annotations:
     summary: High error rate detected
     description: Error rate is above 5% for the last 5 minutes
   ```

2. Service Down
   ```yaml
   alert: ServiceDown
   expr: up == 0
   for: 5m
   labels:
     severity: critical
   annotations:
     summary: Service is down
     description: {{ $labels.instance }} has been down for more than 5 minutes
   ```

3. High Memory Usage
   ```yaml
   alert: HighMemoryUsage
   expr: container_memory_usage_bytes / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes > 0.9
   for: 5m
   labels:
     severity: warning
   annotations:
     summary: High memory usage detected
     description: Container memory usage is above 90%
   ```

### Warning Alerts

1. High Latency
   ```yaml
   alert: HighLatency
   expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) > 2
   for: 5m
   labels:
     severity: warning
   annotations:
     summary: High latency detected
     description: 95th percentile latency is above 2 seconds
   ```

2. Pod Restart
   ```yaml
   alert: PodRestart
   expr: changes(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[1h]) > 2
   labels:
     severity: warning
   annotations:
     summary: Pod restarting frequently
     description: Pod {{ $labels.pod }} has restarted more than 2 times in the last hour
   ```
