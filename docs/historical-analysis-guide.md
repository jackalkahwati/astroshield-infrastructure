### Key Components

1. **Analysis Points**: Time-series data containing metrics and assessments for each point in time
2. **Anomalies**: Unusual events or behaviors detected during the analysis period
3. **Trend Summary**: A natural language summary of the observed trends
4. **Metadata**: Information about the object and pagination details

## Interpreting Threat Levels

Threat levels in historical analysis results indicate the assessed risk at each point in time:

| Threat Level | Description | Recommended Action |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| NONE | Normal operation with no significant risk | Continue routine monitoring |
| LOW | Minor anomalies or slightly elevated risk | Review data and increase monitoring frequency |
| MEDIUM | Significant anomalies or elevated risk | Investigate cause and prepare contingency plans |
| HIGH | Critical anomalies or high risk | Immediate investigation required, consider maneuver planning |
| CRITICAL | Extreme risk requiring immediate action | Execute emergency procedures and mitigation strategies |

### Understanding Confidence Values

Each threat level assessment includes a confidence value between 0 and 1:

| Confidence Range | Interpretation | Action |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| 0.9 - 1.0 | Very high confidence | Rely on assessment with minimal additional validation |
| 0.75 - 0.89 | High confidence | Consider assessment reliable but verify key decisions |
| 0.5 - 0.74 | Moderate confidence | Additional verification recommended |
| 0.25 - 0.49 | Low confidence | Treat as tentative and seek additional data |
| 0.0 - 0.24 | Very low confidence | Do not rely on assessment without verification |

Low confidence values often indicate:
- Incomplete sensor data
- Conflicting measurements
- Unusual or unprecedented behavior
- Conditions outside the system's normal operating parameters

## Interpreting Metrics in Detail

### Position and Velocity Uncertainty

Position uncertainty (measured in meters) and velocity uncertainty (measured in meters per second) indicate the precision of tracking data:

| Position Uncertainty | Assessment | Implications |
|----------------------|------------|-------------|
| < 10 m | Excellent | High-precision tracking with minimal uncertainty |
| 10-50 m | Good | Standard tracking quality for most operational purposes |
| 50-100 m | Moderate | Acceptable for most routine operations |
| 100-500 m | Concerning | May indicate tracking difficulties or unusual conditions |
| > 500 m | Poor | Significant tracking issues requiring investigation |

Velocity uncertainty follows similar patterns but at different scales (typically in cm/s or m/s).

### Signal Strength

Signal strength (measured in dBm) indicates the quality of radar or other returns:

| Signal Strength | Interpretation |
|-----------------|---------------|
| > -70 dBm | Very strong signal, excellent quality data |
| -70 to -85 dBm | Strong signal, reliable data |
| -85 to -95 dBm | Moderate signal, generally reliable data |
| -95 to -105 dBm | Weak signal, data may have increased noise |
| < -105 dBm | Very weak signal, data reliability concerns |

### Maneuver Probability

The maneuver probability metric estimates the likelihood that an object has maneuvered:

| Probability | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 0.0 - 0.1 | Very unlikely | Normal operations |
| 0.1 - 0.3 | Possibly maneuvered | Increase monitoring |
| 0.3 - 0.7 | Likely maneuvered | Review recent tracking data |
| 0.7 - 1.0 | Almost certainly maneuvered | Investigate and update orbit estimation |

## Analyzing Trends

When reviewing historical analysis data, look for these patterns:

1. **Stability**: Consistent metrics with minimal variation indicate stable spacecraft behavior
2. **Gradual Changes**: Slow trends may indicate natural orbital evolution or systematic issues
3. **Sudden Changes**: Abrupt changes may indicate maneuvers, collisions, or equipment failures
4. **Oscillations**: Regular patterns may indicate control system behavior or environmental factors
5. **Anomalies**: Outliers or flagged events require special attention and investigation

### Visualizing Historical Data

For optimal interpretation, consider visualizing the historical data:

1. **Time Series Plots**: Create time series plots of key metrics like position uncertainty, threat level, and signal strength
2. **Comparison Views**: Compare metrics before and after anomalies or suspected maneuvers
3. **Heat Maps**: Use heat maps to visualize density of events or anomalies over time
4. **3D Trajectory Visualizations**: For complex spatial analysis, use 3D visualizations of trajectories and uncertainty volumes

### Critical Patterns to Watch For

| Pattern | Description | Possible Causes | Recommended Response |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Threat level escalation | Progressive increase in threat levels over time | Orbital degradation, approach of another object | Increase monitoring frequency, prepare contingency plans |
| Oscillating uncertainty | Cyclical changes in position/velocity uncertainty | Sensor coverage variations, attitude changes | Correlate with orbital period, verify sensor coverage |
| Sudden uncertainty spike | Rapid increase in position uncertainty | Possible maneuver, sensor failure, space weather | Investigate immediately, verify with alternative sources |
| Declining signal strength | Progressive weakening of return signal | Attitude change, hardware failure, increased range | Check sensor performance, validate with other sensors |
| Increasing anomalies | Growing frequency of anomaly detections | Changing behavior, system degradation | Detailed review of all anomalies, look for patterns |

## Example Scenarios

### Normal Operations

A spacecraft showing consistent metrics with low uncertainty values and no detected anomalies is exhibiting normal behavior. The threat level will typically be "NONE" with high confidence values (>0.85).

**Example pattern:**
- Position uncertainty: 10-30m with minimal variation
- Velocity uncertainty: 0.01-0.03 m/s with minimal variation
- Signal strength: Consistent within 3-5 dBm
- Maneuver probability: Consistently <0.1
- No anomalies detected

### Possible Maneuver

Look for:
- Sudden changes in position uncertainty
- Elevation in maneuver probability metric (>0.3)
- Brief increase in threat level followed by return to normal
- Anomaly of type "POSSIBLE_MANEUVER" or "SUDDEN_POSITION_CHANGE"
- Signal strength variations during the event

**Example timeline for a typical maneuver:**
1. T-24h: Normal tracking data, low uncertainties
2. T-1h: Last normal tracking point
3. T+0: Gap in tracking data or sudden increase in uncertainties
4. T+2h: Position uncertainty spike (often 2-10x normal values)
5. T+6h: Maneuver probability increases to >0.5
6. T+12h: New orbit determination completed
7. T+24h: Return to normal uncertainty values but with new orbital parameters

### Deteriorating Situation

Warning signs include:
- Steadily increasing position and velocity uncertainty over multiple data points
- Decreasing confidence values in threat assessments
- Escalating threat levels over time (e.g., from NONE to LOW to MEDIUM)
- Multiple anomalies in a short timeframe
- Declining signal strength indicating possible hardware issues

**Response protocol:**
1. Increase monitoring frequency
2. Validate data with alternative sources
3. Review recent conjunction assessments
4. Prepare contingency plans for potential issues
5. Consider scheduling a health check maneuver if appropriate

### Anomalous Signature Changes

When an object's signature changes unexpectedly:
- Variations in signal strength patterns
- Changes in radar cross-section values
- Anomaly types like "SIGNATURE_CHANGE" or "UNEXPECTED_ATTITUDE"
- Possible changes in thermal profiles if available

**Possible causes:**
- Deployment of solar panels or antennas
- Attitude control issues
- Partial system failure
- Impact with small debris
- Beginning of controlled/uncontrolled tumbling

## Advanced Interpretation Techniques

### Correlation with External Events

For comprehensive analysis, correlate historical data with:
- Space weather events (solar flares, geomagnetic storms)
- Published maneuver notices
- Known launch and deployment activities
- Reported anomalies from spacecraft operators
- Atmospheric density changes (for low Earth orbit objects)

### Statistical Analysis

Apply statistical methods to extract deeper insights:
- Calculate baseline statistics (mean, standard deviation) for each metric during nominal periods
- Use moving averages to smooth out noise and highlight trends
- Apply anomaly detection algorithms to identify subtle deviations
- Compare behavior against similar spacecraft types for benchmarking

### Using Pagination Effectively

For long analysis periods, use pagination to efficiently process data:
1. Start with a broader timescale (larger `page_size`) to identify periods of interest
2. Focus on specific periods with smaller `page_size` for detailed analysis
3. Use the `page` parameter to navigate through large datasets systematically
4. Consider processing data by month or week for systematic long-term analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Review**: Schedule periodic reviews of historical data for all critical assets
2. **Baseline Establishment**: Create baselines of normal behavior for each spacecraft
3. **Correlation**: Compare historical analysis with known events (maneuvers, system changes)
4. **Timespan Selection**: Analyze different timespans to identify both short and long-term trends
5. **Data Export**: Export analysis data for further processing with specialized tools when needed
6. **Cross-Validation**: Validate significant findings with multiple data sources when possible
7. **Documentation**: Maintain records of significant events and findings for future reference
8. **Team Review**: Have multiple analysts review critical assessments before taking action

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Missing data points | Gaps in sensor coverage, database issues | Check for sensor outages, use interpolation with caution |
| Inconsistent threat levels | Conflicting data sources, processing errors | Review raw data, check for sensor calibration issues |
| Unexpected anomalies | New behavior patterns, algorithm sensitivity | Validate with alternative methods, adjust sensitivity if needed |
| Low confidence assessments | Insufficient data, edge conditions | Seek additional data sources, manual review |
| Contradictory trend summary | Complex behavior patterns, algorithm limitations | Perform manual analysis, consider time subsections |
