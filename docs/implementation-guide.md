# CCDM Service Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed information on implementing and deploying the Conjunction and Collision Data Management (CCDM) service in various environments.

## System Architecture

The CCDM service follows a microservice architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- **Conjunction Service**: Core service for conjunction detection and analysis
- **Object Catalog Service**: Manages space object metadata and orbital parameters
- **Notification Service**: Manages alerting and reporting
- **Analytics Service**: Provides data aggregation and visualization capabilities
- **Database Layer**: Stores conjunction data, space object information, and user data
- **Caching Layer**: Improves performance for frequently accessed data
- **Message Queue**: Enables asynchronous processing for computationally intensive tasks

## Deployment Options

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. Apply the Kubernetes manifests:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

2. Verify deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ccdm
   ```

### On-Premises Installation

For air-gapped environments, follow these additional steps:

1. Download all required dependencies and container images
2. Transfer to the target environment
3. Configure the local registry
4. Follow standard deployment procedures

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- API and core services can be scaled horizontally
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic
- Configure auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics

### Database Scaling

- Implement read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Consider sharding for very large datasets
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- Implement Redis caching for:
  - Frequently accessed conjunction data
  - Space object catalog information
  - Authentication tokens
  - Computed collision probabilities

### Data Management

- Implement data retention policies to manage storage growth
- Archive historical data to cold storage
- Implement data aggregation for historical analysis

### Rate Limiting Configuration

Configure rate limits based on subscription tier:

| Tier | Requests per Minute | Burst Capacity |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| Basic | 60 | 100 |
| Standard | 300 | 500 |
| Premium | 1000 | 2000 |
| Enterprise | Customizable | Customizable |

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Configure token expiration policies
- Implement OAuth2 for third-party integrations

### Authorization

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Define fine-grained permissions for different API endpoints
- Audit all access to sensitive data

### Data Protection

- Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.3
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive data

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

- Implement Prometheus for metrics collection
- Track API response times, error rates, and system resource utilization
- Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization

### Logging

- Implement centralized logging with Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack)
- Log all API requests, errors, and system events
- Configure log rotation and retention policies

### Alerting

- Configure alerts for critical system conditions:
  - High error rates
  - Elevated response times
  - Resource constraints
  - Security-related events

## Disaster Recovery

- Implement regular database backups
- Configure multi-region deployments for high availability
- Document recovery procedures for various failure scenarios
- Test recovery processes regularly

## Integration with External Systems

- Support webhooks for real-time event notifications
- Provide data export capabilities in standard formats (CSV, JSON)
- Document API integration points for third-party systems

## Customization

The CCDM service can be customized for specific use cases:

- Custom risk assessment algorithms
- Organization-specific reporting templates
- Integration with proprietary data sources
- Custom authentication mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **API Timeouts**: Check database performance and connection pooling configuration
- **High Memory Usage**: Review caching strategy and data aggregation settings
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify token configuration and key management
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Check replication status and database indexes
