# AstroShield Microservice System Design

## 1. Integration Architecture

### Node-RED Integration
- Primary integration platform: Node-RED
- Environment separation:
  - Development environment for testing and prototyping
  - Production environment for live deployment
- Data ingestion strategy:
  - Pull-based architecture from UDL
  - 10-second polling intervals
  - Alternative to event-driven approach

### API Architecture
- REST endpoints supporting:
  1. UDL data ingestion
  2. Custom data source integration
  3. Data processing capabilities
- Rate limiting implementation to prevent system overload
- Performance metrics and model confidence scores included in responses
- Security considerations:
  - TLS encryption
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - Access control

## 2. Development Process

### Sprint Schedule
- Monthly sprint cadence (transitioned from bi-weekly)
- Key dates:
  - Sprint kickoff: December 2nd/3rd
  - Mid-point check: December 11th
- Focus on prototype development for demonstrations
- Documentation requirements:
  - Node-RED onboarding materials
  - Video tutorials for system usage

## 3. Technical Requirements

### API Requirements
- Rate limiting implementation
- Performance metrics tracking
- Model confidence score integration
- Security measures:
  - TLS encryption
  - Authentication
