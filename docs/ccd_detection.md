# Space Domain CCD Detection Capabilities

## Overview

This document describes the Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception (CCD) detection capabilities implemented in our space domain awareness platform. These capabilities are designed to align with the DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) program's prototype capabilities for countering space domain CCD.

## Core Components

### 1. UCT Analysis with UDL Integration
The UCT (Uncorrelated Track) Analyzer now provides comprehensive detection of potential CCD activities through UDL data integration:

- **Environmental Analysis**
  - Space Weather Conditions (Kp index, DST, F10.7)
  - Radiation Belt Activity
  - Lunar Interference
  - RF Environment

- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**
  - Cross-sensor correlation
  - Quality-weighted confidence
  - Temporal alignment

- **Motion Analysis**
  - State vector history analysis
  - Velocity change detection
  - Maneuver characterization

- **CCD Indicators**
  ```python
  ccd_indicators = [
      'signature_management',  # Dim object characteristics
      'unusual_orbit',        # Non-standard orbital parameters
      'event_correlation',    # Temporal correlation with events
      'unusual_maneuver',     # Suspicious motion patterns
      'rf_anomaly'           # RF environment anomalies
  ]
  ```

### 2. BOGEY Scoring System

Implements the DnD methodology for prioritizing unidentified objects:

- **Base Score**: Starts at 10.0
- **Modifying Factors**:
  - Custody Duration (linear decay over 1 year)
  - Area-to-Mass Ratio (AMR) Analysis
  - Near-GEO Delta-V Requirements
  - Environmental Confidence Adjustments

#### Scoring Formula
The updated scoring formula ensures consistent and bounded results:

1. **Base Score Adjustment**
   ```
   base_adjusted_score = base_score * custody_factor * amr_factor
   ```
   where:
   - `base_score` starts at 10.0
   - `custody_factor` decays linearly from 1.0 to 0.0 over 1 year
   - `amr_factor` ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 based on AMR characteristics

2. **GEO Bonus Calculation**
   ```
   geo_bonus = base_adjusted_score * geo_score * 0.25
   ```
   where:
   - `geo_score` = 1.0 - (delta_v_to_geo / 10.0)
   - Limited to 25% of the adjusted base score
   - Only applies to GEO-class objects

3. **Final Score**
   ```
   bogey_score = min(10.0, base_adjusted_score + geo_bonus)
   ```
   - Ensures score never exceeds 10.0
   - Maintains proportional relationship between factors

#### AMR Factor Ranges
| AMR Value | Description | Factor |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| < 0.01 | Very dense object | 1.0 |
| 0.01 - 0.1 | Typical satellite | 0.9 |
| 0.1 - 1.0 | Rocket body | 0.7 |
| > 1.0 | Debris | 0.5 |

#### Environmental Impact on Scoring
| Condition | Confidence Reduction |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Lunar Interference | -20% |
| High Solar Activity | -10% |
| High Radiation Belt | -10% |

### 3. Debris Event Analysis

Enhanced detection of potential CCD activities during debris events:

- **Temporal Correlation**
  - Event timing analysis
  - Pattern recognition
  - Concurrent deployment detection

- **Spatial Analysis**
  ```python
  indicators = [
      'temporal_correlation',  # Event timing
      'unusual_amr',          # Object characteristics
      'unusual_clustering',    # Distribution patterns
      'excessive_debris',     # Count anomalies
      'controlled_motion'     # Deliberate movement
  ]
  ```

## Implementation Examples

### 1. UCT Analysis with UDL Data
```python
result = uct_analyzer.analyze_uct(
    track_data,
    illumination_data,
    lunar_data,
    sensor_data,
    space_weather,      # New UDL data
    radiation_belt,     # New UDL data
    rf_interference,    # New UDL data
    state_history      # New UDL data
)
```

### 2. Environmental Analysis
```python
env_factors = analyzer._analyze_environment(
    illumination_data,
    lunar_data,
    space_weather,
    radiation_belt
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**
   - Maintain high-quality sensor calibration
   - Validate multi-sensor correlations
   - Track observation quality metrics
   - Monitor UDL data freshness

2. **Analysis Workflow**
   - Start with environmental analysis
   - Apply UCT analysis with UDL data
   - Calculate BOGEY score
   - Conduct debris analysis if applicable

3. **CCD Detection**
   - Monitor for known CCD tactics
   - Track temporal correlations
   - Validate against baseline behavior
   - Consider environmental conditions

## Known CCD Tactics

1. **Payload Concealment**
   - Debris event cover

   - Non-standard orbits
   - RF masking

2. **Deceptive Operations**
   - Unusual maneuvers
   - Controlled objects in debris fields
   - Temporal correlation with events
   - Environmental exploitation

3. **Signature Management**
   - Dim object characteristics
   - Variable signatures
   - Eclipse period activities
   - RF signature manipulation
