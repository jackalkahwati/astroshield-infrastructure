# User Readiness Checklist

This checklist focuses on making the CCDM system ready for users rather than adding new features.

## Error Handling & Validation
- [x] Implement input validation for `get_historical_analysis` - norad_id, start_date, and end_date parameters
- [x] Add ISO format validation for date strings with clear error messages
- [x] Standardize error responses across all API endpoints for consistent user experience
- [x] Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse for resource-intensive endpoints
- [x] Implement proper status codes based on error conditions (400 for validation, 404 for missing resources, etc.)
- [x] Add input validation for conjunction event parameters
- [x] Validate minimum/maximum values for analysis time windows
- [x] Implement comprehensive exception handling for Space-Track API integration

## Database Management
- [x] Ensure database connections are properly closed when exceptions occur
- [x] Add index on `norad_id` field in the Spacecraft table to improve query performance
- [x] Add pagination support for large historical datasets to prevent memory issues
- [x] Implement database connection retry logic for improved reliability
- [x] Add transactions for multi-step database operations
- [x] Implement proper connection pooling configuration
- [x] Create database migration scripts for version control
- [ ] Add data validation constraints at database level

## Performance Optimization
- [x] Add caching for frequently accessed historical data

- [x] Implement background processing for long-running operations
- [ ] Add compression for large response payloads
- [ ] Optimize bulk data retrieval operations
- [x] Implement query result caching with appropriate TTL values

## Concurrency & Thread Safety
- [x] Implement proper locking mechanism for database transactions
- [x] Use singleton pattern for CCDMService to prevent multiple initializations
- [x] Add connection pooling for database access
- [x] Ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources
- [ ] Implement read/write locks for resource contention
- [ ] Add distributed locking for multi-instance deployments
- [x] Implement connection timeouts to prevent thread starvation
- [ ] Add deadlock detection and prevention

## Logging & Monitoring
- [x] Add request ID tracking for easier troubleshooting
- [x] Implement more granular logging for the `get_historical_analysis` method
- [x] Add metrics collection for performance monitoring (response time, error rate)
- [x] Log all database operations with appropriate detail levels
- [x] Set up structured logging with JSON format
- [ ] Create custom metrics for conjunction analysis outcomes
- [ ] Implement tracing for multi-service requests
- [x] Configure log rotation and retention policies
- [x] Add critical event alerting for operational issues

## Security & Authentication
- [x] Ensure all endpoints have proper authentication requirements
- [x] Validate and sanitize user inputs (especially norad_id) to prevent injection attacks
- [x] Implement API key validation and rate limiting
- [x] Add audit logging for security-sensitive operations

- [x] Implement JWT token expiration and refresh logic

## Deployment & Environment
- [x] Create health check endpoint to verify service status
- [x] Add readiness probe to ensure database connectivity is established
