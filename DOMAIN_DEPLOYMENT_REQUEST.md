# AstroShield Public Domain Deployment Request

## 🎯 **Objective**
Enable public access to AstroShield at **https://astroshield.sdataplab.com/**

## ✅ **Current Status**
- **✅ AstroShield Platform**: Fully deployed and operational on EC2
- **✅ All Services**: Running successfully (Frontend, Backend, Databases, Monitoring)
- **✅ Internal Access**: Working via SSH tunnels
- **❌ Public Access**: Blocked due to DNS and security group configuration

## 🔧 **Required Changes**

### **1. DNS Configuration Update**
**Current Configuration (Incorrect):**
```
astroshield.sdataplab.com → 3.31.152.218
```

**Required Configuration:**
```
astroshield.sdataplab.com → 56.136.120.99
```

**Action Required:** Update the DNS A record for `astroshield.sdataplab.com`

### **2. AWS Security Group Configuration**
**Current Status:** All web ports blocked (security groups deny HTTP/HTTPS traffic)

**Required Ports to Open:**
- **Port 443** (HTTPS) - Primary access
- **Port 80** (HTTP) - For HTTPS redirect

**Action Required:** Modify security group to allow inbound traffic on ports 80 and 443

## 📊 **Verification**

After changes are made, the following should work:
- ✅ `https://astroshield.sdataplab.com/` → AstroShield Dashboard
- ✅ `http://astroshield.sdataplab.com/` → Redirect to HTTPS
- ✅ SSL certificate validation
- ✅ All AstroShield features accessible publicly

## 🛡️ **Security Notes**

- SSL/TLS certificate is already configured (self-signed)
- Application-level security is in place
- All internal services remain protected
- Only web interface (ports 80/443) would be exposed

## 📋 **Technical Details**

- **Server IP**: 56.136.120.99
- **Services Ready**: Nginx configured for HTTPS
- **SSL Configured**: Self-signed certificate in place
- **Application Status**: All components operational

---

**Once these changes are made, AstroShield will be fully accessible at the public domain as requested.**
