# AstroShield Deployment Status Summary

## Current Status
- Local deployment on EC2 is **WORKING** - the containers are running correctly
- Local access via `curl` from within the EC2 instance works - returning the proper HTML
- Domain resolution issue: The domain astroshield.sdataplab.com points to 3.31.152.218
- EC2 instance has a different IP: 56.136.120.99

## Key Issues
1. **DNS Mismatch**: The domain is pointing to the wrong IP address
2. **Port Accessibility**: External access to ports 80/443 appears to be blocked

## Solution Steps

### Immediate Access
1. Try accessing the site directly using the EC2 IP address:
   - http://56.136.120.99/
   - https://56.136.120.99/ (may show certificate warning)

### DNS Configuration Fix
1. Update the DNS A record for astroshield.sdataplab.com to point to 56.136.120.99
2. DNS changes can take up to 24-48 hours to propagate globally

### Security Group Fix
1. Verify AWS Security Group settings for the EC2 instance
2. Ensure inbound rules allow traffic on ports 80 and 443 from all sources (0.0.0.0/0)

### Certificate Fix
1. Once DNS is correctly pointing to the instance, generate a proper SSL certificate
2. Consider using Let's Encrypt for a free, trusted certificate

## Notes
- The application itself is working correctly on the EC2 instance
- The deployment shows content locally when accessed via curl
- This is primarily a networking/DNS issue, not an application issue
