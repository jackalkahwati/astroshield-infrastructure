## Next Steps

1. **Implement Dockerfile Standardization**
   - Create standardized Dockerfiles for all components
   - Set up multi-stage builds for production
   - Implement proper security scanning

2. **Consolidate Duplicate Code**
   - Identify and merge duplicate functionality
   - Create shared libraries for common operations
   - Establish clear code ownership

3. **Extend Testing Coverage**
   - Implement integration test suite
   - Add end-to-end testing
   - Set up performance testing infrastructure

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**
   - Standardize build and deploy processes
   - Implement proper environment promotion
   - Add security scanning to CI pipeline

5. **Documentation Expansion**
   - Add API documentation with examples
   - Create troubleshooting guides
   - Add architecture decision records (ADRs)
