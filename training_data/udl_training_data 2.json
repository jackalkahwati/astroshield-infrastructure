    "output": "A TLE (Two-Line Element set) is a data format used to convey orbital information about Earth-orbiting objects. Each TLE consists of two lines of 69 characters each, encoding information such as epoch, orbital inclination, right ascension of ascending node, eccentricity, argument of perigee, mean anomaly, mean motion, and a checksum.\n\nIn space operations, TLEs are used to:\n1. Predict satellite positions using propagation models like SGP4\n2. Schedule satellite communications and observations\n3. Plan collision avoidance maneuvers\n4. Track space debris\n5. Calculate satellite visibility from ground stations\n\nTLEs are regularly updated by organizations like the US Space Force and shared through services like the Space-Track catalog and the Unified Data Library (UDL)."

    "text_input": "What is a state vector in orbital mechanics?",
    "output": "A state vector in orbital mechanics is a mathematical representation of an object's position and velocity in three-dimensional space at a specific moment in time (epoch). It consists of six components:\n\n1. Position components (x, y, z): The satellite's location in 3D space, typically measured in kilometers relative to Earth's center in an Earth-centered inertial (ECI) coordinate system.\n\n2. Velocity components (vx, vy, vz): The satellite's velocity vector, typically measured in kilometers per second in the same coordinate system.\n\nState vectors are fundamental in space situational awareness because they:\n- Provide an instantaneous snapshot of an object's trajectory\n- Can be propagated forward or backward in time using physics models\n- Can be converted to other orbital representations like Keplerian elements\n- Are used in conjunction analysis, maneuver planning, and reentry predictions\n- Serve as inputs to more complex space mission design calculations"
