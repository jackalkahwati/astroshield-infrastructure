# United States Space Force Data & Artificial Intelligence FY 2025 Strategic Action Plan

> *“Never a day without space data.”*

## Introduction

The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) has made clear that the United States will achieve peace through strength by restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding the military, and reestablishing deterrence. The SECDEF emphasized the critical role of innovation, high standards, and accountability in ensuring the United States remains the world’s most dominant military force, with a focus on lethality, meritocracy, and readiness. 

As the world’s first digital service, the United States Space Force (USSF) recognizes the critical role that data and artificial intelligence (AI) will play in maintaining space superiority. The USSF recognized the need for digital fluency within the Guardian workforce, and based on the latest national guidance, the Space Force needs to emphasize AI literacy to employ these tools to solve operational challenges. China’s rapid expansion in space—utilizing AI for surveillance, offensive capabilities, and space-based operations—alongside Russia’s advancements in counter-space technologies and electronic warfare pose significant threats to global security. In this contested and congested domain, superiority will be defined by our ability to integrate with interagency, allies, and commercial partners to advance data capabilities, real-time analytics, and emerging AI technologies to outpace adversaries and maintain operational superiority. 

Recognizing that unity and shared purpose are the greatest strengths of the Department of Defense (DoD), the USSF has developed the **United States Space Force Data and AI FY 2025 Strategic Action Plan** to address these challenges as a space enterprise. This plan provides clear direction for the USSF to address the urgency of this moment collectively. Building on the foundational efforts of the inaugural Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 plan, it outlines a clear, actionable path toward becoming a more data-driven and AI-enabled force capable of achieving the DoD’s mission to deter war and, when necessary, decisively defeat our adversaries. The plan aligns with the National and Defense priorities, centering on four key Lines of Effort (LOEs) that will enable the USSF to continue securing our Nation’s interests in, from, and to space:

- **LOE 1:** Mature Enterprise-Wide Data and AI Governance  
- **LOE 2:** Advance a Data-Driven and AI-Enabled Culture  
- **LOE 3:** Rapidly Adopt Data, Advanced Analytics, and AI Technologies  
- **LOE 4:** Strengthen Government, Academic, Industry, and International Partnerships
